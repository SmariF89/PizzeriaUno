# PizzeriaUno
A simple React application representing a fictional pizza restaurant's homepage with a pizza menu, offer menu and a cart.

NOTE: I did not implement the Node.js backend web service which is located in ther server folder. I only implemented this React application which utilises the web service.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure to have Node.js and NPM installed.

### Installation
Open two terminals, one in the client folder and another in the server folder. Run "npm install" in both folders.

### Getting started
Keep the two terminals from last step open. Run the command "npm start" in both terminals.

### Functionality
#### Menu
The menu contains overview of all available Pizzas. Along with the Menu anchor, clicking on the logo will also redirect you back to the Menu. Clicking on a pizza opens up a detail view for that pizza with an ability to add it to the cart.

#### Offers
Displays all available offers. An offer can be added to the cart, containing any of the available pizzas and some soda.

#### Cart
Inside the cart the user has overview of his orders, he can cancel by removing from the cart or decide to go to checkout. In the checkout, the user can choose if he wants to pick up or have the pizza delivered. He will need to input valid and appropriate information.

#### About
Contains info about the fictional Pizzerio Uno restaurant with an address, phonenumber and an email.
